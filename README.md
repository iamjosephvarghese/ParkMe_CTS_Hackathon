# ParkMe_CTS_Hackathon


Project developed as part of #FUTURIST hackathon conducted at Cognizant, Kochi. Interfaces the Google Assistant with Node MCU (ESP8266) to find the closest vacant parking spot in a building complex. Uses Dialogflow to set-up a conversational flow, firebase for the real-time database, cloud functions and Heroku for the backend.
